		- `Tab` to go a level deeper 👉
		- And `Shift+Tab` to come back 👈
	- Convert lists to checklists by choosing "Add checkbox to children" in the item menu or `Ctrl+Shift+C`
		- If you put your mouse on a list item, a hamburger menu icon and a 🔍 icon will show up
			- Click on the 🔍 to "zoom in" on that item
			- Click on the menu for a number of other options (this menu is called the item menu)
	- You can select multiple items as well! Simply drag the mouse to select
	- Create a new document by clicking on the "+" icon in the header of the left sidebar
	- Right click on a document for a list of things you can do with it
