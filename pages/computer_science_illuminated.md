- overview and history
	- computing system
		- information
			- bit_binary number system
			- character_information we use(numbers, letters, etc)
		- hardware
			- input devices(like keyboard),
			- computer
				- gates and circuits
				- CPU
				- memory
			- output devices(like printers),
		- software
			- programming language
				- managing data
			- operating system
				- interact with computer
			- application
				- solve specific problems
		- network/communication
			- conmmunicating with other devices
			- information secure
		- limitations of computers
	- history of hardware
		- computers
			- turing machine
			- IBM's Harvard Mark I, ENIAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC I
			- 'memory' to storage information, from vacuum tube to transistor,
			- 'integrated circuits' combines transistor and other components in one board, make them cheaper, smaller and faster,
			- 'terminal', an input/output device,
			- machine language, instructions to tell the computer how to compute,
		- parallel computing
			- increase the speed of execution,
			- types
				- SIMD (single-instruction,multiple-data-stream) , one step in a program can be separated into multiple pieces, and those pieces can be executed simultaneously on several individual processors.
				- MIMD (multiple-instruction, multiple-data-stream) , different steps of a program can be executed simultaneously on different machines.
			- Software designed for parallel machines is different from software designed for sequential machines, which means programmers have to rethink the coding,
		- network
			- from connecting different computers to sharing information,
			- cloud computing
	- history of software
		- machine language
			- long strings of binary digits, such as 00110011,
			- eventually, every program that is executed on a computer must be in the form of the computerâ€™s machine language,
		- assembly language
			- use 'translators' to 'translate' each machine-language instruction to easy-reading codes,
			- FORTRAN, COBOL, Lisp,
		- high-level language
			- enable same programs running on different computers.
			- use 'compiler' to translated into machine instructions to be executed,
		- operating system
			- allocate computer resources to different programs
		- software
			- enable not-programmer user to finish some works through the computer
			- Object-oriented design
				- structured design is based on a hierarchy of tasks, object-oriented design is based on a hierarchy of data objects.
				- structured programming: BASIC, C and C++ are introduced,
		- Internet
			- World Wide Web, a universal Internet document center,
			- HTML, a language for formatting documents,
- information system
	- Number systems and binary
		- basics
			- arithmetic operation, integer, natural numbers,
		- number system
			- base
				- the foundational value of a number system
				- base 2(0,1) is 'binary', base 8 is 'octal', base 10(0,1,2...9) is 'decimal', and base 16 is 'hexadecimal',
				- base n only has n-1 digits, base 10 does not has symbol for '10'(10 is made by 1 and 0) ,
			- number transformation
				- polynomial method
					- number 10110 in base 2
						- written as 1*2^4 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 22 in base 10,
					- number 123 in base 8
						- written as 1*8^2 + 2*8^1 +3 = 73 in base 10,
				- transform from base 10
					- find the nearest power of base, delete the base, find the nearest power of the reminder, and so on,
					- number 22 is 16(2^4) + 6(reminder), 6 is 4(2^2) + 2(reminder), 2 is 2^1, so that 22 is 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1,
			- arithmetic operation
				- adding in binary is similar to decimal('carry and borrow' method)
					- we can convert the number back to decimal to check whether we are correct,
				- 8 and 16 is 2's power, so binary, octal and hexadecimal has special relationship,
		- binary digit(bit)
			- each storage location within a computer can have only one of two states,
			- so each storage unit is called a 'binary digit', or 'bit' for short.
