			- abstraction data type,
			- statements : declaration, conditional, loop,
			- function(static methods) : call, return,
		- running a Java program
		  collapsed:: true
			- compile with `javac file.java` command,
			- file will be compiled to a bytecode file suffix by class,
			- run with `java file` command,
		- basic data type
		  collapsed:: true
			- real numbers : include `int` and  `double`,
			- booleans : only have true, false,
			- characters(and symbols)  `char`
		- advanced data type
		  collapsed:: true
			- array
			  collapsed:: true
				- concept : stores a *sequence* of values that are all of the *same* type,
				- declare and initialize
				  collapsed:: true
					- like C arrays, but use `new`keyword to declare,
					- `double[] a = new double[N];`
					- it's legal to declare and initialize at the same time,
					- `int[] a = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 };`,
				- index method
				- dot method
				- two-dimensional array
				  collapsed:: true
					- similar to ordinary array, `double[][] a = new doubl[M][N];`
					- 'M' is the number of rows, 'N' is the number of columns,
					- nested for loops coule be used to initialize values,
			- string
			  collapsed:: true
				- concept : similar to an array, while all elements are characters, and always surrounded by quotes `""`,
				- methods
					- operator
					  collapsed:: true
						- use `+` to add(concatenate) two string is legally in Java,
					- convesion
					  collapsed:: true
						- `toString`function can convert int or double to string,
						- automatic conversion : when using `+` operator with one string, Java will automatically convert other types of data to string; so one method is add one empty string, like `string s = 12 + "";`,
		- basic operation (expression)
		  collapsed:: true
			- assignment (need pre-declaration)
			  collapsed:: true
				- the name of variables usually called "identifier",
				- declare and initialized a variable at the same time is legally, `int i = 1;`,
			- arithmetic operations
			  collapsed:: true
				- type conversion (casting)
					- casting to an `int` is truncation(cut the decimal) instead of rounding,
				- Increment/decrement shortcut
					- like `i++`, `i--`,
				- compound operation shortcut
					- `i/=2;` is equivalent to `i = i/2;`,
			- logical operations
			- operator precedence
		- control flow
		  collapsed:: true
			- conditionals
			  collapsed:: true
				- if-else template : `if (boolean expression) {statements}`,
			- loops
			  collapsed:: true
				- while template : `while (boolean expression) {statements}`,
				- for template : `for (initialize; boolean; increment)  {statements }`,
				- `break` and `continue `,
			- complex programs typically have a *nested* structure, which means these statement seldom uses solely,
		- function
		  collapsed:: true
			- java's function often named as `static methods`, here `static` is used to distinguish from `instance`,
			- defining
			  collapsed:: true
				- similar to C function, but prefixes `public static` keyword,
				- explicit return is not necessary for void static method,
				- `void`function won't *return* values, but might *change* global variables, need to be careful,
			- call and return
		- input and output
			- `stdlib` module
				- book algorithm's internet page provides an alternative module for input/output stream,
				- https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ includes Java environment setting, `stdlib` moudle setting, java codes in the book, and some solutions to the exercises,
				- after installation, `javac-introcs`*and* `java-introcs` should be able to use in command line, or the compiler will report mistakes,
				- an alternative way is download `.java` file to work direction, which the ordinary `javac` command will works; while the disadvantage is the need to duplicate `.java` file to every working d
				- the APIs are described in https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/,
			- I/O streams
			  collapsed:: true
				- standard input/output stream are associated with an application, which supported by either the *operating system* or the *development environment*,
				- it provides the `terminal window` interface for users,
				- By convention, both programming language and the operating system process the user's *input* arguments as *strings*,
			- basic I/O methods
				- main function
					- like C, Java's main function can receive these inputs as arguments,
					- therefore, main is writed as `main(String[] args)`, and  `String[]` means a string array,
				-
	- programming model
		- recursion
		  collapsed:: true
			- concept: a method can call itself,
			- keypoints
			  collapsed:: true
				- base case: always has a return
				- recursive case
				  collapsed:: true
					- always are smaller problems,
					- may have many cases,  while these cases should be disjoint,
				- it's easy to analyze recursion model's performance through mathematical tools,
		- modular programming
		  collapsed:: true
			- advantage
			  collapsed:: true
				- abstraction of lower-level methods can make program easier to understand as well as clearer,
				- people could use existing APIs from external libraries, so that they don't need to reproduce these basic methods,
				- "client - implementation" separation is important as well, for example, malware could use implementation code to find bugs and attack libraries,
			- APIs(application programming interfaces)
			  collapsed:: true
				- program which uses a method in another library often named as "client", and code to implement these written method always called "implementation",
			- modular ideas
			  collapsed:: true
				- it's important to treat every *own program* as a module and *try to reuse* them in the future,
				- APIs : write *presice note* about the method, include the function's usage, received data type and return type,
				- testing : use some different examples to *test methods*' availability, through including `main()` function in module, and write the tests in the main function,
