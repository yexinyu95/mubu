  collapsed:: true
	- abstraction
	- moore's law
		- single thread's ability is growing slower today, while now the enhancement is mostly due to multi threads,
	- memory hierarchy
	- parallelism computation

		  collapsed:: true
			- binary
			  collapsed:: true
				- always present by prefix `0b`,
				- transistor could only present two values,
				- most significant bit(msb) and least significant bit(lsb)
			- translation between binary and decimal,
			  collapsed:: true

			- hexadecimal
			  collapsed:: true
				- always present by prefix `0x`,
				- group of four from right to left,
		- signed numbers
		  collapsed:: true
			- sign and magnitude
			  collapsed:: true
				- use first bit to represent the sign(negative`-` or positive`+`),
				- will make two zeros,
			- (one's complement)
			  collapsed:: true
				- reverse the bit of positive numbers,
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1663925258364_0.png){:height 85, :width 289},
				- still have two zeros,
			- two's complement
			  collapsed:: true
				- common used,
				- $\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}  \hline  000 & 001 & 010 & 011 & 100 & 101 & 110 & 111 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\\hline \end{array}$，
				- first bit still represent the sign(1 is negative),
		- (bias encoding)
		  collapsed:: true
			- like $\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}  \hline  000 & 001 & 010 & 011 & 100 & 101 & 110 & 111 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 \\ 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\hline \end{array}$，
			- the representing range shift from [-4, 3] to [0, 6],
		- (IEC notation for powers of two)
- intro to C
	- basic characteristics
		- C is very close to how computer work, so it is perfect to use in teaching computer science,
		- but C is unsafe, so Go(or Java) or Rust is more recommended,
	- compile
	  collapsed:: true
		- disadvantages : compile file are architecture - specific, depending on processor type(x86, ARM) and operating system,
		  collapsed:: true
			- gcc creates machine language code,
			- javac creates 'bytecode' used in jvm(java virtual machine), which is closer to machine code but not same,
		- Pre-processor
			- `#include`statements just *copy* the file, but not *execute* the code,
	- data types
	  collapsed:: true
		- numerical types
		- const variable
		- enumerator types
	- struct and typedef
	- functions
	- "undefined behavior"
		- these codes k crash every time, but it may crash randomly)
- arithmetic operation
- components of a computer
	- processor
		- control
		- ALU
		- registers
	- memory
